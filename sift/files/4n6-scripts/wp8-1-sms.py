Data Notes:
===========
\\Users\WPCOMMSSERVICES\APPDATA\Local\Unistore\store.vol contains SMS text messages, contact and limited MMS information.
\\Users\WPCOMMSSERVICES\APPDATA\Local\UserData\Phone contains call log information.
\SharedData\Comms\Unistore\data contains various .dat files for MMS messages

From analysis of MPD store.vol test data (Nokia 520 Windows 8 phone) there are two areas of focus (tables?) for SMS data

Area 1 = The "SMStext" content area. Each SMS message has its own record within this area.
Each content record seems to follow one of these structures:

[?][FILETIME1][?][FILETIME2][?][PHONE0][[1 byte]["IPM.SMStext" string][1 byte][PHONE1][1 byte][PHONE2][1 byte][PHONE3][1 byte][Received Message][?][FILETIME3][?][FILETIME4] 
or
[?][FILETIME1][?][FILETIME2][?]["IPM.SMStext" string][1 byte][Sent Message][?][FILETIME3][?][FILETIME4] 

? = unknown / varying number of bytes
All strings are Unicode UTF-16-LE and null terminated
FILETIMEs are 8 byte LE and record the number of 100 ns intervals since 1 JAN 1601 (ie MS FILETIME)

For MPD test data, there seems to consistently be:
 0xBF bytes between FILETIME2 and "SMStext" for Sent SMS (0xB7 bytes between start of "IPM.SMStext" and start of FILETIME2)
 0xEA bytes between FILETIME2 and "SMStext" for Recvd SMS (subject to length of PHONE0)

For the supplied OHIO data, There seems to consistently be:
 0xB4 bytes between FILETIME2 and "SMStext" for Sent SMS
 0xDF bytes between FILETIME2 and "SMStext" for Recvd SMS (subject to length of PHONE0)

CHECK YOUR DATA OFFSETS! They will probably vary between phones / data sets.

Unfortunately, sent SMS does not record the destination phone number in Area 1 records.
For these, we need to check an area of store.vol we'll call Area 2. The records in Area 2 look like:

[?][FILETIMEX][0x1B bytes]["SMS" string][1 byte][PHONEX][?]

Note: the Area 2 record formats seemed consistent between the Nokia 520 and HTC phones.
FILETIMEX value seems to correspond exactly to an Area 1 record's FILETIME2 field. 
So we might be able to find out the destination number of a sent SMS by doing a search of Area2 fields for a specific FILETIMEX value.
This seems to work well with our MPD test data.

Program Notes:
==============
Given a specified input store.vol and output TSV filename, this script will
- Search for "SMStext" entries (in Area 1 ie "Message" table) and store the sent/recvd direction, FILETIME2, Text message, Offset of the Text Message and PHONE1.
- For any sent SMS, it will also look up the destination phone number (in Area 2 ie "Recipient" table) using FILETIME2 / FILETIMEX as a key.
- Print out results to a nominated Tab Separated Variable file format (screen output is not typically large enough)

Known Issues:
- Offsets might have to be adjusted between phones/datasets particularly between the start of FILETIME2 and the start of "SMStext".
This script version tries an experimental method of calculating the offset so the user doesn't have to (theoretically).
- There may be unprintable characters in null term string fields AFTER the NULL but before the 0x1 field marker. Added goto_next_field function to handle these.
- If the script does not detect Unicode digits 0x11 bytes before the start of "SMStext", it ass-umes that the message is a Sent SMS (ie no numbers). This also means that SMS with one/two digit phone numbers might not be identified correctly as received.

Change history:
v2014-08-30: 
- Revised for non-printable characters appearing after the null in nullterm unicode strings but before the 0x1.
- Assumes each field is demarcated by 0x01 bytes.
- Also adjusted the max offset range for Sent SMS FILETIME2 based on test data. Increased it to 0xEA (from 0xC4).

v2014-09-01:
- Changed logic so that if we don't see Unicode digits before "SMStext", the script assumes the message is a Sent SMS (no numbers).
- Decreased Sent SMS "find_timestamp" min parameter based on 1SEP data to x7D (from 0xAF)

v2014-09-05:
- Added trace output for when the script skips record extractions (ie when it can't find/read fields)
- Adjusted minimum "find_timestamp" parameters based on MPD log data to 0x9B for received SMS

v2014-09-29:
- Modified read_nullterm_unistring so it returns whatever valid characters it has read on a bad read exception.
Previously, it was returning an empty string. This was done to handle emoticons ... 

v2014-10-05:
- Renamed script from "win8sms-ex2.py" to "wp8-sms.py"

v2015-07-10:
- Changed script to search for hex strings in chunks of CHUNK_SIZE rather than in one big read 
(makes it quicker when running against whole .bin files). Thanks to Boss Rob :)

v2015-07-12:
- Removed "all_indices" function which was commented out in previous version
- Adjusted some comments

v2015-08-19:
- Fixed bug in chunking code where it was not processing the last chunk properly
- Adjusted DELTA to cater for a larger max size record
- Adjusted timestamp search max offset for received SMS

v2015-08-26:
- Adjusted FILETIME2 offsets for Lumia 530 WinPhone 8.10
- Added some debug printing for auditing false hits
